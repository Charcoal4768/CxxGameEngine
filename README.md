This is a simple C++ game engine. I made it as an educational project to teach myself how rendering pipelines, object collisions, physics and various mini-systems behind real game engines actually work.
This repository includes an asteroid game made with the engine. It has healthbars floating above damageable entities and a fun gameplay loop.
The engine follows a building-blocks style achritecture where complex objects and UI elements can be created by mixing severall different base structs
